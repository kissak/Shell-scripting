GENERAL INFORMATIONS
Linux subsystem for Windows can be installed from the Microsoft Store

Linux command syntactics: command + [option(s)] + [argument(s)]
	-- means can't be combined together
~ - means the user's home folder
. - shourtcut to our current directory (only .), when we want to copy something into our current directory
kissak@ABSNK465:~$ - means username@host_name:name_of_the_current_folder

$ - read the value of the variable after it
'' - take the string exactly literaly except * and ?, unlike "" where variables got replaced
\$USER - \ is the escape character
echo '\' - print \
echo \'text\' - echoes 'text', used \ as escape characters

daemon = system service listening inthe background
swap is when process data is loaded between the memory and file system, it makes the process slow

Login to Linux:
	1. login shell: provide password and account
	2. executes the /etc/profile
	3. executes /etc/profile.d/*.sh, together with /etc/profile they hold all the systemwide environment and shell variable
	4. executes ~/.bash_profile, which holds user environment and shell variables
	5. executes ~/.bashrc
	6. executes /etc/bashrc, which holds systemwide aliases and functions
	7. returns control to ~/.bashrc to set user aliases and shell functions
	8. user logged in

Non-login shell: when you start a shell in a terminal in an existing session
	1. executes ~/.bashrc
	2. executes /etc/bashrc, which holds systemwide aliases and functions
	3. returns control to ~/.bashrc to set user aliases and shell functions
	4. shell runs

WinSCP is for file transfer to and from your server, it is a file transfer application using Secure FTP.
PuTTY is used to interact with the server directly, it is just a command line interface to your server.

press TAB for auto completion
press TAB twice for showing the possible options when it cannot decide

User types:
	- normal user: can only modify its own files, cannot make system changes
	- super user (root): modify any file, make system changes

.file_name - hidden file

Common directories of a Linux filesystem
	/ - Root. The root filesystem is the top-level directory of the filesystem. It must contain all of the files required to boot 
		the Linux system before other filesystems are mounted. It must include all of the required executables and libraries required
		to boot the remaining filesystems. After the system is booted, all other filesystems are mounted on standard, well-defined 
		mount points as subdirectories of the root filesystem.
	/bin - Common executable programs, shared by the system, the system administrator and the users.
	/boot - Contains the static bootloader and kernel executable and configuration files required to boot a Linux computer.
	/dev - This directory contains the device files for every hardware device attached to the system. These are not device drivers,
		   rather they are files that represent each device on the computer and facilitate access to those devices.
	/etc - Contains the local system configuration files for the host computer.
	/home - Home directories of the common users. Each user has a subdirectory in /home.
	/lib - Contains shared library files that are required to boot the system and includes files for all kinds of programs needed by the system and the users.
	/lost+found - Every partition has a lost+found in its upper directory. Files that were saved during failures are here.
	/media - A place to mount external removable media devices such as USB thumb drives that may be connected to the host. /media is where the system mounts removable media
	/misc - For miscellaneous (mindenféle) purposes.
	/mnt - Standard mount point for external file systems, e.g. a CD-ROM or a digital camera. /mnt is for you to mount things manually.
	/net - Standard mount point for entire remote file systems
	/opt - Typically contains extra and third party software.
	/proc - A virtual file system containing information about system resources.
	/root - The administrative user's home directory. Mind the difference between /, the root directory and /root, the home directory of the root user.
	/sbin - Programs for use by the system and the system administrator.
	/tmp - Temporary space for use by the system and many programs, cleaned upon reboot. Users may also store files here temporarily.
	/usr - Shareable, read-only files, including executable binaries and libraries, man files, and other types of documentationfor all user-related programs.
	/var - Storage for all variable files and temporary files created by users, such as log files, the mail queue, the print spooler area, space for
		   temporary storage of files downloaded from the Internet, or to keep an image of a CD before burning it.

				   contains lines unique to FILE1, column two contains 
				   lines unique to FILE2, and column three contains lines 
				   common to both files.

diff file1 file2 - analyzes two files and prints the lines that are different, it's telling you how to change the first file to 
				   make it match the second file. The first line of the diff output will contain: line numbers corresponding to the first file,
				   a letter (a for add, c for change, or d for delete), and line numbers corresponding to the second file.
				   - lines preceded by a < are lines from the first file
				   - lines preceded by > are lines from the second file
				   - three dashes ("---") merely separate the lines of file 1 and file 2
				  - "2,4c2,4" means: "Lines 2 through 4 in the first file need to be changed to match lines 2 through 4 in the second file.
				    It then tells us what those lines are in each file. "2a3" After line 2 in the first file, a line needs to be added: line
					3 from the second file." It then shows us what that line is. "4d3" You need to delete line 4 in the first file so that 
					both files sync up at line 3. It then shows us the contents of the line that needs to be deleted.

awk '/manager/ {print}' employee.txt - print the lines which matches with the given pattern
awk '{print $1,$4}' employee.txt - splitting a line into fields ($0 is the entire line)
Awk’s built-in variables:
	- field variables—$1, $2, $3, and so on ($0 is the entire line), that break a line of text into individual words or pieces called fields
	- NR: NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records
	- NF: NF command keeps a count of the number of fields within the current input record.
	- FS: FS command contains the field separator character which is used to divide fields on the input line, the default is “white space”, meaning space and tab characters
	- RS: RS command stores the current record separator character, since, by default, an input line is the input record, the default record separator character is a newline
	- OFS: OFS command stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints them, the default is a blank space
	- ORS: ORS command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when Awk prints them, the default is a newline character

PRIVILEGES
sudo <command> -  run the command with super user privileges
	sudo is meant to run a single command with root privileges, but unlike 
	su it prompts you for the password of the current user. This user must
	be in the sudoers file (or a group that is in the sudoers file). By 
	default, Ubuntu "remembers" your password for 15 minutes, so that you 
	don't have to type your password every time.
		- enter user's password
		- elevates privileges for one command
		- all command execution is logged
		- granular permission system, only allows certain people certain privileges
sudo -s - switch over to the super user (root@ABSNK465:~/#)
sudo -k - give up sudo privileges
sudo su - Switch to root. It is still a very useful command for one important
		  reason: When a user is running “su” to gain root access on a system,
		  they must know the root password. The way root is given with sudo su
		  is by requesting the current user’s password. This makes it possible
		  to gain root without the root password which increases security.
su - switch user
	The command su is used to switch to another user (Switch User), 
	but you can also switch to the root user by invoking the command
	with no parameter. su asks you for the password of the user to 
	switch, after typing the password you switched to the user's 
	environment.
		- enter root's password
		- elevates privileges for whole session
		- no accountability, all users who switch are root
		- all-powerfull for anyone who has the password
exit - switch back from super user

File permission:
	- first character: The first mode field is the "special file" designator, 
					   regular files display as - (none). As for which possible
					   letters could be there, on Linux the following exist:
						- d (directory)
						- c (character device)
						- l (symlink)
						- p (named pipe)
						- s (socket)
						- b (block device)
	- first upcoming block of 3 characters: owner of the file (User (u))
	- second upcoming block of 3 characters: group that owns the file Group (g))
	- third upcoming block of 3 characters: others, not in the group (Others (o))
	- (All (a))

File permission types
	r - read (4)
	w - modify (2)
	x - execute (1)
	
Octal value:
	0 - ...
	1 - ..x
	2 - .w.
	3 - .wx
	4 - r..
	5 - r.x
	6 - rw.
	7 - rwx

Symbolic file permissions:
	+ - adds permission
	- - removes permission
	= - adds listed permissions but removes all the others not listed

chmod 700 sum.md5 - change permission, all for owner, nothing for the group and others
chmod g+rw sum.md5 - change permission for group, give read and write access to the group of the owner
chmod g-w sum.md5 - change permission for group, revoke write access from the group
chmod u=r sum.md5 - change permission for user, assign read permision, but remove all others if exists 

sudo chown root test.sh - change owner of the file

SUMMARY OF LESS COMMANDS
LESS is a terminal pager program on Unix, Windows, and Unix-like systems used to 
view (but not change) the contents of a text file one screen at a time. It has 
faster access because if file is large, it don’t access complete file, but access
it page by page.

less filename - show the first page of the file

h - display help
q - exit
v – using the configured editor edit the current file
f - forward one window
b - backward one window
G - jump to the end
g - jump to the beginning
:n – go to the next file, when you opened more than two files
:p – go to the previous file, when you opened more than two files
/pattern - search forward for (n-th) matching line
?pattern - search backward for (n-th) matching line

PACKAGE, ARCHIVE AND COMPRESS FILES AND FOLDERS
tar: tape archives, common way to package and distribute software, data compression is optional (tar.gz, .tgz)
tar -cvf myfiles.tar asd/ - create an archive file called myfiles.tar from the asd/ folder
	-cf - create an archive and output the a file to an archive
	-v - list out all the files while doing the work
	-z - gzip compression on the tar archive
tar -caf myfiles.tar.gz asd/ - 
	-a - tells to find out what compression to use based on the file extension
tar -xf myfiles.tar.bz2 -C unpack2/- unpack/uncompress the specified file
	-x - unpack the specified file
	-C - unpack to the specified folder
	-a - tells to find out what decompression to use based on the file extension

gzip filename.txt - can only archive files, the common practice with GZIP, is to archive all the files into a single tarball before compression
	-l filename.txt.gzip - list compressed file contents
	-5 - It allows to change the compression level.A file can be compressed in different ways. For instance, you can go for a smaller
		 compression which will work faster or you can go for maximum compression which has the tradeoff of taking longer to run.
		 The speed and compression level can vary by levels using numbers between 1 and 9.
	-k - by default when you compress a file using the “gzip” command you end up with a new file with the extension “.gz”, if you 
		 want to compress the file and keep the original file you have to run the gzip command with -k option
	-v - displays the name and percentage reduction for each file compressed or decompressed
	-r folder/- This option can compress every file in a folder and its subfolders.This option doesn’t create one file called 
		 foldername.gz. Instead, it traverses the directory structure and compresses each file in that folder structure.
	-d filename.txt.gzip - decompress
	
tar czvvf archive.tar.gz asd/ - create tar package and then compress the file with gzip ftom the files in the specified folder
tar xavvf archive.tar.gz -C extract_dir - extract double extracted file into the specified folder

zip file.zip file.txt - zip a file
zip -r exfiles.zip asd/ - create a zip file from the specified folder in the specified folder, shows how much a file reduced
	-r - create a zip file recursively
zip -u files.zip "asd/file3.txt"
	-u - can be used to update the specified list of files or add new files to the existing zip file
zip -d files.zip "asd/file3.txt" - removes the file from the zip archive
	-d - removes the file from the zip archive
unzip exfiles.zip - unzip a file
	-d folder_name - unzip to the specfied folder

pbzip2 myfile.tar - compress the file "myfile.tar" into the compressed file "myfile.tar.bz2", uses multiple cores to compress files, so it is faster
	-d myfile.tar.bz2- decompress file
	-p# - where # is the number of processors

ftp ftp.wscbau.hu - create ftp connection to a server
rsync foo/ - If only the source path is specified, the contents of the source are listed in an output format similar to ls -l
rsync -avh foo/ bar/ - If neither the source or destination path specifies a remote host, the rsync commands behave as a copy command
rsync -avhze ssh /asd ftp.wscbau.hu:/tmp - 
rsync -a ~/dir1 username@remote_host:destination_directory - Once you have SSH ACCESS verified on between the two machines, you can sync the dir1 
															 folder from earlier to a remote computer by using this syntax (note that we want to
															 transfer the actual directory in this case, so we omit the trailing slash). This is 
															 called a “push” operation because it pushes a directory from the local system to a remote system.
rsync -a username@remote_host:/home/username/dir1 ~/dir2 - Once you have SSH ACCESS, it is used to sync a remote directory to the local system.										 
	-a - archive mode, archive mode allows copying files recursively and it also preserves symbolic links, file permissions, user & group ownerships and timestamps
	-v - verbose
	-z - compress file data


SYSTEM CONFIGURATION

1. local environment variable: last only till the current session
2. user environment variable: efined for a particular user and are loaded every time a user logs in,
   set in and loaded from following configuration files: .bashrc, .bash_profile, .bash_login, .profile
   files which are present in user’s home directory
3. system wide environment variables: available system-wide, i.e. for all the users present on that system.
   these variables are present in system-wide configuration files. these variables are loaded every time system
   is powered on and logged in either locally or remotely by any user.
   
Understanding User-Wide and System-wide Configuration files
.bashrc: This file is user specific file that gets loaded each time user creates a new local session i.e. in 
		 simple words, opens a new terminal. All environment variables created in this file would take effect
		 every time a new local session is started.
.bash_profile: This file is user specific remote login file. Environment variables listed in this file are invoked
			   every time the user is logged in remotely i.e. using ssh session. If this file is not present, system
			   looks for either .bash_login or .profile files.
/etc/environment: This file is system wide file for creating, editing or removing any environment variables. Environment
				  variables created in this file are accessible all throughout the system, by each and every user, both
				  locally and remotely.
/etc/bash.bashrc: System wide bashrc file. This file is loaded once for every user, each time that user opens a local
				  terminal session. Environment variables created in this file are accessible for all users but only
				  through local terminal session. When any user on that machine is accessed remotely via a remote login 
				  session, these variables would not be visible.
/etc/profile: System wide profile file. All the variables created in this file are accessible by every user on the system,
			  but only if that user’s session is invoked remotely, i.e. via remote login. Any variable in this file will
			  not be accessible for local login session i.e. when user opens a new terminal on his local system.

SSH means secure shell: provides a secure channel over an unsecured network in a client–server architecture
Auto login using ssh keys (uses assymetric keys)
	1. ssh-keygen -t rsa - generate public-private key pair: create ssh key on the machine
	2. ssh username@remote_host "cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys < ~/.ssha/id_rsa.: transfer the public key generated to the remote host and append it to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

ssh username@remote_host - ssh connect, default port 22
	-p - add port to use
ssh username@remote_host "echo user: $(whoami) - run command on a remote host with ssh

lftp username@host.~>put/get filename - old file transfer protocol, default port 21
sftp user@domain_name - new file transfer protocol, default port 22
	-oPort=422 - change port used

scp filename user@host:path - secure copy to a remote machine
	-r - recursively copy entire directories

port forwarding - enable other computers to connect to a particular service on a remote server using your machine
ssh -L 8000:www.kernel.org:80 test@test-desktop - forward from my local machine to another machine
ssh -L 8000:www.kernel.org:80  user@remote_machine - forward it from a remote machine to another machine

reverse port forwarding: a machine is not publicly available from the internet, but I want others to acccess a service in that machine
ssh -R 8000:www.kernel.org:80 test@test-desktop

sshfs -o allow_other user@remote:/path path_local - mount remote drives
umount path - unmount remote drive

nc -l 1234 - create listening socket
nc 1234 - initiate a connection to a remote host
